💡 What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet or intranet. It mainly involves three core technologies:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
Used to structure web pages and define content such as text, images, links, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Used to style and design web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.

JavaScript
Used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior such as form validation, animations, and user interactions.

Together, these technologies form the foundation of modern web applications.
